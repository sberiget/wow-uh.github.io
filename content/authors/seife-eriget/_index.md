Currently, my main research focus is large-scale urban hydrology modeling and the scaling behavior of flood peaks.

Additionally, I enjoy reading eastern mystic books, particularly those on the non-dual path and self-realization, which are also part of my daily life exploration. Besides that, playing and watching soccer are my favorite activities.
