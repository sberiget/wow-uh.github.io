After my graduation, I pursued a career in industry and contributed to consulting projects of hydrologic and hydrodynamic modeling, floodplain mapping and stormwater management under various local agencies of Canada and Bangladesh. My journey in this field has been shaped by both academic rigor and hands-on professional experience in diverse hydrologic landscapes. Growing up in Bangladesh, I witnessed firsthand the critical interplay between water resources and natural hazards, which inspired my commitment to bridging cutting-edge research and practical water management solutions.

In Dr. Liâ€™s research group, I aim to develop an advanced understanding for managing water resources in the face of climate change and increasing anthropogenic pressures. My research focuses on watershed hydrology, urban flood mitigation, and river morpho-dynamics, with an emphasis on addressing challenges in transboundary river systems and deltaic environments.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, learning about history and geography, and exploring new cultures.
