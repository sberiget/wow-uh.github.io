My current main research focus is on modeling the drought response of natural watershed sites at the pan-tropic scale. My modeling research uses large data sets fed into Earth System Models.

I am an avid film ethusiast, primarily of the horror genre. I also enjoy solving puzzles of all types and engaging in interactive media.
