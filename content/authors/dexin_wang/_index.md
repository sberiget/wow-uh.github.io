Currently, my primary research focuses on urban flood simulation, urban stormwater networks, and sediment modeling. I also have a strong interest in exploring the applications of machine learning in these fields.
Apart from research, I like walking, traveling, exercising, watching movies, and cooking with my wife, enjoying the peaceful life.
