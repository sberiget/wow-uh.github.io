Throughout my undergraduate studies, ever since I took my hydrology and water quality courses, I became interested in these subjects. As a freshman and sophomore, I had the opportunity to collaborate with the late Dr. Carlos Patino-Gomez, we carried out research regarding the aquifers that provide the most water resources to Puebla (Mexico), and the stateâ€™s water needs for every sector, specifically the urban one, to determine the exploitation levels of aquifers (for example, the ones in Tecamachalco Valley and Balsas River), to aid in establishing a new management model for hydrological resources to guarantee equal access to them by everyone. Now, as a Master's student, I am interested in learning about the development and application of accurate computational tools used for watershed modeling and understanding their hydrology.
